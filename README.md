* To create a new project without Expo: `react-native init TheBox`, following the React Native [quickstart docs](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).
* To create a new project with Expo: `create-react-native-app TheBox`, following the React Community [GitHub page](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

I created a project *with* Expo. This produced the success response:

> Success! Created TheBox at `/Users/jamie/Documents/git/TheBox`.
> Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
> 
>  `yarn start`
>  Starts the development server so you can open your app in the Expo app on your phone.
> 
>  `yarn run ios`
>  *(Mac only, requires Xcode)*
>  Starts the development server and loads your app in an iOS simulator.
> 
>  `yarn run android`
>  *(Requires Android build tools)*
>  Starts the development server and loads your app on a connected Android device or emulator.
> 
>   `yarn test`
>  Starts the test runner.
> 
>  `yarn run eject`
>  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
> 
> We suggest that you begin by typing:
> 
>   `cd TheBox`
>   `yarn start`

Before doing any of these steps, I decided to integrate TypeScript by following cbrevik's [blog post](http://blog.novanet.no/easy-typescript-with-react-native/).

1. `yarn add --dev react-native-typescript-transformer typescript`

2. `touch rn-cli.config.js` and write the following into it:

```TypeScript
module.exports = {  
  getTransformModulePath() {
    return require.resolve('react-native-typescript-transformer')
  },
  getSourceExts() {
    return ['ts', 'tsx'];
  }
}
```

3. `touch tsconfig.json` and write your desired settings, eg.:

```JSON
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2015",
    "module": "es2015",
    "jsx": "react-native",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  }
}
```

4. Now refer to cbrevik's [react-native-typescript-starter](https://github.com/cbrevik/react-native-typescript-starter) project for an example working project.
