# React Native Typescript 2D Game

## About the game

Around 2006, my brother made a simple Flash game called [The Box](https://birchlabs.co.uk/legacy/TheBox.html). In this game, you'd control a small blue box that has to run away from an ever-growing red box that is hunting it. The game would end upon the blue box being caught. You could attempt to live longer by picking up power-ups that would hinder the red box, but loss was ultimately inevitable.

## Technologies

This repository aims to reproduce The Box using modern mobile technologies. We're using:

* **Expo:** for rapid development of the app (allows you to develop without touching Xcode/Android Studio; is pre-configured with hot-reloading; has its own app store for instant publishing; provides debug tools, etc.).

* **React Native:** as a library for developing an cross-platform phone app using React's reactive architecture.

* **TypeScript:** to write type-safe, refactorable, auto-completing code yet still output JavaScript (the language of React Native).

For instructions on how exactly to make a project like this for yourself from scratch, read the repository wiki's [How I created this project](https://github.com/shirakaba/react-native-typescript-2d-game/wiki/How-I-created-this-project) page.
