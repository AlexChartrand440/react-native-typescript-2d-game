/**
 * "Good enough" rectangle-based collision detection. Obviously the red box becomes more dangerous (and the blue box
 * becomes more vulnerable) when rotated, as the hitboxes increase to encompass their 'diamond shapes' in upright
 * rectangles. In the original The Box Flash game, this was compensated for by simply reducing the hitbox size whilst
 * the red box was rotated (and the blue box didn't even rotate!). This solution would be both practical and performant.
 * TODO: implement Separating Axis Theorem-based collision detection if feeling brave.
